This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You can download this repo using the clone command in the git console

git clone https://github.com/aliriomiguel/alidex.git

Now you can run in you local machine. To do so follow the next steps:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The pokeApi is called in the api.ts file in /utils directory.

I made the calls through a hook using tanstack's reack-query

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
